```
- Token Size
- Stateless Nature
- Increased Payload Exposure
```
- [ x] Disadvantages of indexing in mongoldb
```
- Increased Storage Space:  Indexes require additional storage space to store the index data structure.  
- Increased Write Overhead: Indexes need to be updated whenever a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.
- Index Maintenance: As data is modified in MongoDB, indexes need to be continually updated to reflect these changes.
- Indexes May Not Always Improve Performance:
- Increased Complexity:
